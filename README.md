Simple and probably buggy Game Of Life in Elm
=============================================

Code I started writing at [Elmsinki meetup #2 at 2016-05-04|http://www.meetup.com/Elmsinki/events/230661980/] and got it working the next day. I tried to do most of obvious cleanup but not sure what kind of structural fixes should be done. All feedback is very much welcome.

Runnable using `elm reactor` from the working directory and going to [http://127.0.0.1:8000/GameOfLife.elm].
