Simple and probably buggy Game Of Life in Elm
=============================================

Inspired by Elmsinki meetup #2 at 2016-05-05.

Yay, I got it pretty much working. Much cleanup to do still.

Runnable using `elm reactor` in the checkout directory and going to [http://127.0.0.1:8000/GameOfLife.elm].
